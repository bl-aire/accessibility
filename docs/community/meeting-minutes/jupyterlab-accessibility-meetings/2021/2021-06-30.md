### Attendees

- Mike
- Tony Fast - Quansight
- Isabela
- Adam
- Jason
- Chloe

### What are people working on?

- Adam
  - Does accessibility include accessibility? Answer: yes!
  - Tony shares [The Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/) and [Rin Oliver's Writing Documentation with Neurodivergent Open Source Contributors In Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV-bawUDibc)
- Mike
  - What is an accessible code completion experience? There seems to be a gap in documentation here.
- Chloe
  - What are some things to think about with commenting/chat and RTC that aren't just visual?
  - Think about how to make sure content is marked up in a way that it can be accessed. How does all the info on a page
  - Tony shares `technica11y.org/designing-and-coding-for-low-vision` (currently inaccessible) and https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/
- Isabela
  - The full multi-skiplink is back on the table if people want to work on that. I went to pick it up and it is beyond my current knowledge level (though I'd love to be a fly on the wall of someone working on this).
    - Needs implementation fix based on [#10268](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/10268)
    - Isabela to follow up with Jason
  - BinderHub meeting update [jupyterhub/binderhub #1309](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1309)
  - From the last meetings: [RTC commenting issue](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/10448) and [CodeMirror 6 discussion](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/10370)

### Other ideas

- JupyterLab extension that disables the mouse for manual testing?

### Next Steps

- Update [#8832](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/8832) with info from [#10008](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/10008) and a regression I manually noticed. Turn this checklist into another PR. (Isabela)
- Multiple skiplinks to different regions (Isabela to reach out to Jason)
- Mike is going to look into color stuff? :)
